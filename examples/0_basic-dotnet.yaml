#
# Basic example for executing an OWASP dependency scan against an application
# built with Microsoft's .NET platform.
#
# This scan configuration will:
# - Execute against the default .NET build output directory.
# - Generate a JSON vulnerability report.
# - Add a comment to the triggering pull request with a summary.
# - Upload the generated report as a workflow artifact for 30 days.
# - Fail the job if any high-severity vulnerabilities are found.
